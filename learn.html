            <p>Artificial Intelligence <span>(AI)</span>
                refers to the simulation of human intelligence in
                machines that are programmed to think and act like
                humans. <span>AI</span> enables machines to perform tasks such as
                problem-solving, learning, and decision-making, which
                traditionally require human intelligence.</p>
